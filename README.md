## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Here are some of my favorite apps, and their greatest features (imo).

**MinimaList**
- User-friendly, very easy UI
- No distractions, perfect for concentration
- Every feature is useful and intentional (adding tasks, organizing tasks, different task folders), but never too overcrowded.

**Facebook Messenger**
- Cute themes
- Easy replies (as opposed to iMessage where it feels too repetitive and overdone), each reply refers to one message
- Media and links library is accesible

**Apple Health**
- Simple UI, very on-brand
- Chronological ordering for steps per day, per week, per month, etc.
- UI is pleasant to look at!

**An App I would like to build:**
A productivity app, similar to what I described with MinimaList above, but it focuses more on planning then the execution. 
In terms of planning, I would need to incorporate AI to help the user sort their tasks by brain area, and then make them into smaller/grouped tasks accordingly.
* Some key features my app would have:
- Messy Drafts Board (for unorganized tasks)
- A "regroup" button to reorganize everything by brain area used for that task
- A hold-and-slide to re-arrange the order of the task by yourself
- A time estimate in another column for the task, so that people are not overworking
- Perhaps an incorporated calender to put tasks by day.


## Notes

My main challenges while making this app was mainly figuring out how to use Xcodeas I am previously more used to using a VSCode or Rstudio. Also syncing GitHub to Swift. Xcode was a bit confusing to navigate. The more intuitive incorporation of dragon drop elements while designing. The app kind of threw me off, and it was very interesting writing in the swift coding language for the first time I found it a little similar to JavaScript.
